The last section, Report organization~\ref{sec:report-organization}, explains what the following chapters contain, and how they fit together.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
A web application has a lot of advantages compared to mobile applications. They run on all platforms, have instant updates and are simple to maintain~\cite{michaels2013}. However, a web application cannot access some native mobile features, such as the mobile's accelorometer or camera. A company who wants to access such native features needs to develop a mobile application, which can be very expensive. A small to medium sized project for an Android mobile application is estimated to cost from 20 000 to 40 000 dollars~\cite{kohan2015}.

A company with a web application and the need or desire to extend the web application with mobile native features can develop a mobile application from scratch or by using their existing web application. If the company wants to synchronize events on the mobile and web application, the same back-end can be used, see figure~\ref{fig:common-backend}. Development time will then be spent on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a new mobile application.
\item Maintaining the mobile and web application.
\item Restructuring the web application back-end to a common back-end for the mobile and web application.
\end{itemize}

If the company develops the mobile application by using the existing web application, the web application is run within a shell of the mobile application, see figure~\ref{fig:encapsulated-web}. The web application can then access the mobileâ€™s native functions. This means that the web application back-end does not need to be modified and instead of maintaining several platforms for every feature the mobile application only needs to be maintained in regards of the use of the native functions.

There are a number of approaches of developing a mobile application using different methods. These approaches focus on aspects such as cost, effort and advantages and disadvantages for developing an entirely new mobile application. However, it is very hard to find research on extending an existing web application with mobile native features.

\section{Problem formulation}\label{sec:problem-formulation}
It can be very expensive for companies or organizations to develop a mobile application~\cite{kohan2015}. For a company that already has an existing web application they wish to port to a mobile application, an alternative to developing the mobile application from scratch is therefore interesting. What are the advantages and disadvantages for two different development methods for encapsulating an existing web application in a mobile application to utilize native functions? An example of such a native function would be the mobile's accelerometer. The advantages and drawbacks will be evaluated by looking at development effort, and the way code can be structured in the mobile and web application.

\subsection{Scope} \label{subsec:scope}
To limit the scope of out investigation, the development methods are only evaluted for the mobile operating system Android. Android was choosen since it has a market share of 80.7\% of all smartphone sales~\cite{gartner2015}.

It is assumed that there is an existing web application and that there is a need or desire to extend the functionality with native functions.

The two development methods that are investigated is developing the mobile application using two frameworks. The PhoneGap framework and developing with the Android framework only using the Android SDK. The development methods will be evaluated and compared from a developers perspective. It is assumed that there is an existing web application and that there is a need or desire to extend the functionality of the web application with native functions.

There are two development methods that are investigated. The first method is by using the PhoneGap framework. The second development method is by using the Android framework only using the Android SDK. The development methods will be evaluated and compared from a developer's perspective. It is assumed there already exists	a web application and that there is a need or desire to extend the functionality of the web application with native functions.

\section{Contribution statement}\label{sec:contribution-statement}
Altough there has been research about developing a mobile application with the framework PhoneGap and using the Android SDK, that research focuses on building a mobile application from scratch. In this investigaion, the development methods are compared in the aspect of using an existing web application in the mobile application. The development effort is measured and compared. The way code can be structure in the mobile and web application is proposed. Our investigation gives an insight into the development effort for the different methods and the way code can be structured.

Throughout this work we have been working together very closely. We have reviewed and improved each others work continuously. During development we have often been using pair programming. However, we can attribute parts of our work to one of us more then the other.

Philip designed the code of the web application and the mobile application built natively in Android. David designed the code for the PhoneGap application. David researched different techniques for the communication between the PhoneGap layer and the web application layer. David wrote the Approach chapter~\ref{ch:approach} and the Evaluation chapter~\ref{ch:evaluation}. Philip wrote the Introduction chapter~\ref{ch:introduction} and Discussion chapter~\ref{ch:discussion}.

\section{Report organization}\label{sec:report-organization}
The background chapter~\ref{ch:background} contains theoretical background to this thesis and information about the method used. The chapter approach~\ref{ch:approach} describes our research method and how we measure and analyse the result. In evaluation~\ref{ch:evaluation} the results are presented following the outline in the chapter method. In discussion ~\ref{ch:discussion} we analyse and discuss the results in approach. Finally the thesis is concluded in the conclusion~\ref{ch:conclusions}.
