The section also describes the knowledge gained by this research. Last, the section Report organization \ref{section-report-organization} explains what the following chapters contain and how they fit together.

\section{Motivation}\label{section-motivation}
A web application has a lot of advantages compared to mobile applications. They run on all platforms, have instant updates and are simple to maintain \cite{michaels2013}. However, a web application can't access some native mobile features, such as the mobile's accelorometer. A company who wants to access such native features need to develop a mobile application. Developing a mobile application can be very expensive. A small to medium sized project for an Android mobile is estimated to cost from 20 000 - 40 000 dollars \cite{kohan2015}.

If a company has a web application, they can choose to develop a separate mobile application from scratch. The users activity in the mobile and web application can be synchronized with the use of the same back-end, see figure ~\ref{figure-common-backend}. Development time will be spent on: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a new mobile application.
\item Maintaining the mobile and web application.
\item Restructuring the web application back-end to a common back-end for the mobile and web application.
\end{itemize}

Another alternative, is to create a mobile application using the existing web application. The web application is run within a shell of the mobile application, see figure ~\ref{figure-encapsulated-web}. The web application can then access the mobileâ€™s native functions. This means that the web application back-end does not need to be modified and instead of maintaining several platforms for every feature the mobile application only need to be maintained in regards of the use of the native functions.

There are a number of researches of developing a mobile application using different methods. The researches focuses on aspects such as cost, effort and advantages and disadvantages for developing an entirely new mobile application. However, it is very hard to find research on extending an existing web application with mobile native features. 

\section{Problem formulation}\label{section-problem-formulation}
It can be very expensive for companies or organizations to develop a mobile application \cite{kohan2015}. To investigate an alternative to developing a mobile application from scratch, is therefore interesting.
What are the advantages and disadvantages for two different development methods for encapsulating an existing web application in a mobile application to utilize native functions? An example of such a native function would be the mobile's accelerometer. The advantages and disadvantages will be evaluated by looking at development effort, and how the code can be structured in the mobile and web application. 

\subsection{Scope} \label{subsection-scope}
To limit the scope of the research the development methods is only evaluted for the mobile operating system Android. Android was choosen since it has a market share of 80.7\% of all smartphone sales \ref{gartner2015}.

The development methods that are researched is the PhoneGap framework and developing with the Android SDK. The methods will be evaluated and compared from a developers perspective. It is assumed that there is an existing web application and that there is a need or desire to extend the functionality of it's web-application with native functions.

\section{Contribution statement}\label{section-contribution-statement}
Altough there has been research about developing a mobile application with the framework PhoneGap and using the Android SDK, the research focuses on building a mobile application from the ground up. In this research the development methods are compared while using an existing web application in the mobile application. The development effort is measured and compared and also a code structure is proposed. The research gives an insight into the development effort for the different methods and how the code can be structured.

Throughout this work we have been working together very closely. We have reviewed and improved each others work continuously. During development we have often been pair programming. However, we can attribute parts of our work to one of us more then the other. Even though most of the work has been created together. 

Philip designed the code of the web application and the mobile application built natively in Android. David designed the code for the PhoneGap application. David researched different techniques for the communication between the PhoneGap layer and the web application layer. David wrote the Approach \ref{chapter-approach} section and Philip wrote the Introduction section \ref{chapter-introduction} in this paper. 

\section{Report organization}\label{section-report-organization}
This thesis is presented in a number of chapters. Background, chapter \ref{chapter-background}, contains theoretical background to this thesis and information about the method used. The chapter approach \ref{chapter-method} describes our research method and how we measure and analyse the result. In evaluation\ref{chapter-evaluation} the results are presented following the outline in the chapter method. In discussion \ref{chapter-discussion} we analyse and discuss the results in approach. Finally the thesis is concluded in the conclusion \ref{chapter-conclusion}.
